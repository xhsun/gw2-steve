# Guild Wars 2 Steve

Guild Wars 2 personal assistant application for android.

#### More Specific

This application allows the user to track multiple Guild Wars 2 accounts, so that the user can keep track 
what is in all the accounts without the need to switch back and forth.

*Note: this application is still in development*

## How to Use

To enter a Guild Wars 2 account, the API key need to have permission for `wallet, trading post, 
account, inventories, characters, and unlocks`. I've include an QR code reader for making entering Guild Wars 2 API key easier.

*Note: the permissions required might change as the development continues*
